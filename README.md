<h1> About myself.. </h1>

_I graduated from Seoul National University majoring in Economics, and I wrote a graduate paper on econometrics about youth unemployment rate. Also I took several classes of Seoul National University Graduate School of Data Science. I studied Data Science, Deep Learning and Machine Learning, and Statistics._ <br><br>
_now I'm studying Programming and Software Engineering in Samsung Software Academy For Youth (SSAFY). I really enjoy solving difficult algorithm problems, usually using Java and Python. I achieved the Platinum tier(top 3%) at BOJ, which is the biggest algorithm problem solving website in Korea, after only two months of studying Algorithm. I also got class A at Software Expert Academy(SWEA), which is a algorithm problem solving website operated by Samsung._ <br><br>
_I have a very strong intellectual curiosity and a desire to explore new fields that I have not experienced. I enjoy spending long time pondering and solving difficult problems because it gives me intellectual happiness and I feel I've grown after solving difficult puzzles. I love old rock, blues, and jazz, and I love to play them with my guitar. I've been playing guitar since I was a middle school student, you can listen to my play at my Youtube channel "HEET"(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCueGQkEAOXuxdv6hylwVdfw)._ <br><br>
_I really want to be a good Developer with insights in economics and humanities._
